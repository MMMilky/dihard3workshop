# Submission
DIHARD III participants are invited to submit 2-page extended abstracts via the
[CMT conference management system](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/DIHARDW2020).
These abstracts should focus on providing a technical
description of the systems submitted to the challenge and their results on the DIHARD III
development and evaluation sets; additional results from other datasets also welcome.

The deadline for these extended abstracts is
[Friday August 14th, midnight anywhere on Earth (AoE)](https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?iso=20200814T235959&p0=198&msg=DIHARD+III+Workshop+Abstract+Submission&ud=1&font=sanserif&csz=1).


# Review
All abstracts will be reviewed to ensure that the challenge rules were followed and
sufficient information for interpreting the results provided. Abstracts that conform to
these constraints will be accepted for presentation at the workshop as either a talk or
poster.
