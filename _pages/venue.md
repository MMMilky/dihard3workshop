physical workshop but will instead be conducted as an entirely virtual event.

The workshop will take place Saturday, January 23rd, 2021, beginning at 12:00 PM UTC. Keynote talks and
accepted papers will be presented as pre-recorded video broadcasts via the Zoom Webinar platform. This platform will also be set up to allow participants to
interact with presenters and each other.
