# Venue
Due to COVID-19, the DIHARD III Workshop will no longer take place as a
physical workshop but will instead be conducted as an entirely virtual event.

The workshop will take place Saturday, January 23rd, 2021. Keynote talks and
accepted papers will be presented as pre-recorded video broadcasts via a
"webinar" platform. This platform will also be set up to allow participants to
interact with presenters and each other.

At the moment, we are still working out details for the best way to manage
this shift to a virtual event. Further details will appear on this page when
finalized.
