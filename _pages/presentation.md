# Oral presentation
In the virtual workshop, the oral presentation for each team consists of a pre-recorded video playback and a live Q&A part (20 mins in total). The video will be cast on the virtual platform by the organizers which is followed by live Q&A. 

# Guidelines for slide and video preparation
For extention of each abstract submitted, we request a video of a slide presentation which satisfies the following requirements:
 + Duration: no more than 15 minutes   
 + Video foramt: mp4       
 + Video size: less than 300 MB  
 + Minimum height: 480 pixels
 + Showing the presenter's face in a small window
 
The slide used in the presentation maybe useful in Q&A session, thus a slide should be submitted as well. The requirements are as follows:
 + Slide format: pdf  
 + Slide size: total size of the slide and video should be less than 350 MB 

You could use [zoom](https://us02web.zoom.us/) to record your presentation. Here are simple instructions to record a presentation:
 + Sign in and start a meeting with video on.  
 + Click "Screen Sharing" and select your slide.
 + Click "Recording" to start recording your presetation.  
 + Then finish recording and close the meeting, the video will be created.  

For detailed instructions, [here](https://ieeetv.ieee.org/ieeetv-specials/recording-your-presentation-with-zoom) is a useful HotTo video produced by the IEEE.  
Other recording tools are available like [recordscreen.io](https://recordscreen.io/) if zoom is not useful. The recordscreen.io software is an in-browser recorder that should work in any modern web browser. It has two modes: "Screen Only" and "Screen + Cam". Choose the "Screen + Cam" mode which will place an inset video of yourself in the corner of the screen. No matter using which method, just guarantee the final video meets the requirements. 

# Guidelines for file uploading

# Question and Answer session
Questions will be posted by the audience using Zoom Webinar's Q&A tool and presenters will then be able to answer them live after the video. There are two methods to submit questions:
1. Click the "Raise Hand" button to request asking questions live after the video.  
2. Click "Q&A" button to open the Q&A platform and text questions in the dialog box. The session chairs will select questions submitted by audience and convey them to the presenting authors.
