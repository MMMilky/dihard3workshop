# Oral presentation
In the virtual workshop, the oral presentation for each team consists of a pre-recorded presentation followed by a live Q&A part (20 mins in total). The video of the presentation will be cast in the Zoom Webinar by the organizers, who will then moderate a live Q&A.

# Guidelines for slide and video preparation
For each abstract submitted, we request a video of a slide presentation which satisfies the following requirements:
 + Duration: no more than 15 minutes   
 + Video format: mp4       
 + Video size: less than 300 MB  
 + Minimum height: 480 pixels
 + Showing the presenter's face in a small window
 
The slides used in the presentation may be useful in Q&A session, thus a slide deck should be submitted as well. The requirements for the slide deck are as follows:
 + Slide format: pdf/ppt/pptx  
 + Slide size: total size of the slide and video should be less than 350 MB 

You could use [zoom](https://us02web.zoom.us/) to record your presentation. Here are simple instructions to record a presentation:
 + Sign in and start a meeting with video on.  
 + Click "Screen Sharing" and select your slide.
 + Click "Recording" to start recording your presetation.  
 + Then finish recording and close the meeting, the video will be created.  

For detailed instructions, [here](https://ieeetv.ieee.org/ieeetv-specials/recording-your-presentation-with-zoom) is a useful HowTo video produced by the IEEE.


You can use other recording tools such as [recordscreen.io](https://recordscreen.io/). The recordscreen.io software is an in-browser recorder that should work in any modern web browser. It has two modes: "Screen Only" and "Screen + Cam". Choose the "Screen + Cam" mode which will place an inset video of yourself in the corner of the screen.

# Guidelines for file upload 
The presentation video and slide should be submitted via [CMT conference management system](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/DIHARDW2020) as "Supplementary Material" of your submitted extended abstract. Instructions to complete the submission process are: 
 + Click on the link "Upload Supplementary Material".  
 + Upload your video and slide on the "Files" section. 
 + Click "Submit".

The deadline for submission is January 16th, 2021 at midnight [Anywhere on Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth).

# Question and Answer session
Q&A session can be conducted between presenters and audiences after the video playing with the coordination of the session chair and organizer. There are two modes for Q&A in Zoom Webinar:
 + **Text mode**: the audience members click the “Q&A” button to open a dialog box and can submit their questions in written form at any time during the presentation. The presenter can answer their questions by either text response or live audio response.   
 + **Audio mode**: the audience members click the “Raise Hand” button to request the audio communication. The moderator will then unmute one audience memeber at a time to allow them to ask their question. This mimics the Q&A period of an in person session at a conference and allows the presenter and audience to have a spoken conversation.
