# Oral session
The oral presentation for each team consists of the presentation using pre-recorded video and live Q&A (20 mins in total). The video will be cast on the virtual platform by the organizers which is followed by live Q&A. Questions will be posted by the audience using Zoom Webinar's Q&A tool and presenters will then be able to answer them live after the video. Audience could "raise hand" by Zoom Webinar to propose quenstions or text questions in the dialog box of Webinar. The session chairs will select questions submitted by audience and convey them to the presenting authors. 

# Guidelines for slide and video preparation
For extention of each abstract submitted, we request a video of a slide presentation which satisfies the following requirements:

 + Video foramt: mp4       
 + Video size: less than 300 MB  
 + Minimum height: 480 pixels
 + Showing the presenter's face in a small window
 
The slide used in the presentation maybe useful in Q&A session, thus a slide should be submitted as well. The requirements are as follows:
 + Slide format: pdf  
 + Slide size: total size of the slide and video should be less than 350MB 

You could use [zoom](https://us02web.zoom.us/) to record your presentation. Here are simple instructions to record a presentation:
 + Sign in and start a meeting with video on.  
 + Click "Screen Sharing" and select your slide.
 + Click "Recording" to start recording your presetation.  
 + Then finish recording and close the meeting, the video will be created.  

For detailed instructions, [here](https://ieeetv.ieee.org/ieeetv-specials/recording-your-presentation-with-zoom) is a useful HotTo video produced by the IEEE.  
Other recording tools are available like [recordscreen.io](https://recordscreen.io/) if zoom is not useful. The recordscreen.io software is an in-browser recorder that should work in any modern web browser. It has two modes: "Screen Only" and "Screen + Cam". Choose the 'Screen + Cam' mode which will place an inset video of yourself in the corner of the screen. No matter using which method, just guarantee the final video meets the requirements.
