 + **Text mode**: the audiences click the “Q&A” button to open a dialog box and can text the questions in it anytime during the presentation. The presenter can answer it by either text response or live audio response.   
 + **Audio mode**: the audiences click the “Raise Hand” button to request the audio communication. Then the organizer might select some audiences and unmute their audio setting. In this way, the presenter and audience can have a live conversation.
