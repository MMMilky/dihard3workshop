# Overview
This one-day workshop will bring together researchers to discuss the problem
of robust diarization; that is, diarization that is able to accurately
handle highly interactive and overlapping speech from a range of
conversational domains, while being resilient to variation in, among other
things:

* recording equipment
* recording environment
* reverberation
* ambient noise
* number of speakers
* speaker demographics.

The focus of the workshop will be the [Third DIHARD Speech Diarization Challenge](https://dihardchallenge.github.io/dihard3/)
and all participants in that
challenge are invited to submit papers reporting evaluation results on its
tasks and datasets.
