  University after extensive research experience in academia and industry, including highly
  regarded laboratories at Agnitio and Nuance Communications.  She lead a team of 20+ researchers
  from four of the best laboratories worldwide in far-field speech diarization and speaker
  recognition, under the auspices of the JHU summer workshop 2019 in Montreal , Canada. She was
  also a researcher at Tec de Monterrey, Campus Monterrey, Mexico for 10 years. She was a Marie
  Curie researcher for the Iris project during 2015, exploring assistive technology for children
